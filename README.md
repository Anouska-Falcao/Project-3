# Project 3 - Sentiment Analysis with Deep Learning using BERT

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a text classification model to detect emotions in tweets using a pre-trained BERT model. It classifies tweets into one of six categories: Happiness, Non-Relelvant, Sadness,Anger, Disgust, and Surprise. The primary objective is to build a robust sentiment analysis model capable of predicting the correct emotion from a given tweet with a reasonable level of accuracy.

This project focuses on an end-to-end workflow, from data preprocessing and model fine-tuning to performance evaluation. It provides hands-on experience with applying BERT to real-world text 
classification tasks, emphasizing practical skills in model development and deployment.

## Dataset

We used the SMILE Twitter Emotion Dataset, which contains 3,085 tweets related to British museums. The tweets are labeled with five emotions: anger, disgust, happiness, surprise, and sadness.
